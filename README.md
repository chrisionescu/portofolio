# Examples of work

**Test Scenarios and Test Cases creation**

* I leveraged a live project showcased on YouTube as inspiration for enhancing my expertise in manual testing. Building upon the concepts demonstrated, I crafted additional test cases aligned with the project's documentation. This hands-on experience not only broadened my understanding of manual testing but also honed my skills in test planning. It served as a pivotal opportunity to merge theoretical knowledge with practical application.
